            8/25/23 - Today, we learned about the Goldberg machine, how to edit our websites, hypothesizing, lab safety, and the process of engineering. We also participated in our first challenge where we split into teams and tried to escort a marbel into a bucket using half pipes.

            9/11/23 - We were introduced to cading and a website, Tinkecad, where we could create designs on differents projects. Also, we have made our first model for our Rube Goldberg machine, consistng of three simple machines and started building it with cardboard and duck tape.

            9/18/23 - For our Rube Goldberg machine, we made some minor fixes to our stability of our design, such as cardboard triangles and added extra tape to the side of our project. We noticed that the machine was leaning to the left, so we added carboard triangles to balance it. To satisfy criteria and to make the building process easier, we removed the pulley and added a ramp to create more force for our car to knock the baseball down. After these adjustments, we tested our machine and it worked successfully. At this time, I have added the video for the successful attempt for our project.

            9/27/23 - David and I disected a standard office HP comupter. In this computer, we found many different parts including, the motherboard, CPU, GPU, fan, disk drive, heat sink, audio, and the battery. That was not all the parts of a computer though as we were missing the RAM and wifi module.

            10/4/23 - Today, we were tasked to make prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, and tape and pick up a plastic water bottle. David, Marc, and I were able to successfully build a functional hand for short period of time. O our first attempt, the design did ot work, but with the string, we were able to make mechanism where the string would pull the carboard fingers into a grip position. We also added tape to the tips of the fingers for extra grip. With those mdifications, we were able to pick the water bottle up.
