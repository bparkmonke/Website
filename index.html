            8/25/23 - Today, we learned about the Goldberg machine, how to edit our websites, hypothesizing, lab safety, and the process of engineering. We also participated in our first challenge where we split into teams and tried to escort a marbel into a bucket using half pipes.

            9/11/23 - We were introduced to cading and a website, Tinkecad, where we could create designs on differents projects. Also, we have made our first model for our Rube Goldberg machine, consistng of three simple machines and started building it with cardboard and duck tape.

            9/18/23 - For our Rube Goldberg machine, we made some minor fixes to our stability of our design, such as cardboard triangles and added extra tape to the side of our project. We also removed the pulley and added a ramp to create more force for our car to knock the baseball down. After these adjustments, we tested our machine and it worked successfully.
